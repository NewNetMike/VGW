Detailed item info Product Information &#8220;Mayhem&#8221; is probably an accurate word to describe the first wrestling game from Electronic Arts. A TV-style presentation features play-by-play commentary along with signature entrances enhanced by pyrotechnics and theme music. Over 50 professional wrestlers from World Championship Wrestling are included, although you&#8217;ll need to play through the &#8220;Quest for the Best&#8221; mode to unlock them all. &#8220;Quest for the Best&#8221; has you advancing through three divisions in an attempt to win the TV title, the U.S. title, and the WCW Heavyweight Championship. You can compete on various levels of difficulty and unlock hidden wrestlers along the way, including broadcaster Mean Gene Okerlund and head of security Doug Dillinger. Other featured wrestlers include Goldberg, Sting, Diamond Dallas Page, Hollywood Hogan, and Macho Man Randy Savage. Additional options include a &#8220;Quick Start&#8221; game, a &#8220;Main Event&#8221; match, and the ability to design custom grapplers in the &#8220;Create Wrestler&#8221; mode. As the title suggests, WCW Mayhem is not limited to the confines of the ring. Thirteen backstage areas are available, including locker rooms, boiler rooms, first-aid rooms, and hallways. Various weapons are also included for use against your opponent, from tasers and baseball bats to standard chairs and trashcans. Individual matches can be customized to include the following types of play: Singles, or one-on-one fights; Handicap, where a single player takes on a two-wrestler tag team; Triangle, which pits three wrestlers against each other; Four Way Dance, where four wrestlers fight to be the last man standing; Battle Royal, which involves throwing as many wrestlers over the ropes as possible; and Tag Team, which is a two-on-two contest.

Detailed item info Product Information Those building blocks which everyone plays with when they&#8217;re children now come to the Nintendo 64 with LEGO Racers, one in a series of games featuring the versatile building blocks. In this game players use cars made from LEGO blocks and race them around tracks. In the beginning there are four tracks to choose from and more become available as the player wins circuits. There are also just four racers to choose from initially, with more becoming unlocked as the game progresses. A circuit is made up of four races on four different tracks. During the race, the player has several weapons at his disposal, from maneuvers such as power sliding and super sliding to power ups which shield the car, boost its speed momentarily, or throw objects or hazards at the other cars. A course map gives the car&#8217;s position relative to the others and a timer shows how long it takes to complete each lap. At the end of each race points are awarded based on the finish; at least 10 points, or a third place finish, are necessary to continue with the current circuit. Taking first in the overall circuit unlocks more tracks, cars and characters to choose from. Pieces from different car sets can be mingled to make brand new cars, just like more tangible LEGO sets. The player can also customize their driver, make a license for him, and build a car by selecting which bricks to use. How the car is built, however, will affect its performance on the track. It can be taken out for a test spin on the practice track before putting it into a circuit. In addition to the traditional races, players can also choose from a timed race against the great Veronica Voltage or a versus race against a friend. This game requires a Controller Pak to save your unlocked cars and circuits as well as the new racers which you create. An optional Rumble Pak will shake and rattle your controller with every bump and jostle during the race.

<p>The player can also customize their driver, make a license for him, and build a car by selecting which bricks to use. How the car is built, however, will affect its performance on the track. It can be taken out for a test spin on the practice track before putting it into a circuit.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional races, players can also choose from a timed race against the great Veronica Voltage or a versus race against a friend.</p>
<p>This game requires a Controller Pak to save your unlocked cars and circuits as well as the new racers which you create. An optional Rumble Pak will shake and rattle your controller with every bump and jostle during the race.</font><br class="br"/><br class="br"/></td>
